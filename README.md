# WaitingDiscordBot

### *-Work in Progress-*
This discord bot listens for text messages pertaining to time estimates (i.e. "5 min", "2 secs", or "in 3 hours") and generates a meme image based on that text.

## Requirements
This program uses the discord.py library, which can be installed using the following command (provided you have Python installed):
```
pip install discord.py[voice]
```

Discord.py requires at least [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage
Simply populate `secrets.txt` with values as you see fit, then launch the main python script:
```
python WaitingBot.py
```
